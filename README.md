# QNN-Box-and-Sphere
Using the mujoco physics engine, I create a single joint pivot agent with the ability to apply torque to that single joint. it's goal is to position the joint (attached to a box and sphere for visual effect) at an angle of negative 45 degrees from its starting position. I use a QLearning algorithm with a Q neural net and an epsilon-greedy training method.
